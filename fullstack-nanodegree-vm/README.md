Udacity fullstack project #2: Tournament Results

This is an implementation of the specification for Tournament Results, the second project of the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree. This currently implements only the basic functionality.

## Running the project

* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/barefootlance/udacity-fullstack-p2.git`.
* Install Vagrant
* Install Virtual Box.
* cd into the fullstack-nanodegree-vm/vagrant folder, start up the virtual machine (vagrant up), move to the virtual command line (vagrant ssh).
* cd into /vagrant/tournament
* Run `psql tournament.sql` to initialize the PostgreSQL database on the virtual machine.
* Run `python tournament_test.py`

Running this file executes a small test suite to validate the python code.
